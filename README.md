**Task 1**: For each visited country (City.country), city (City.name) and accommodation type (AccomodationType.name), calculate the number of visitors and profit. Rollup the dimensions and properly format the query result by adding labels at the appropriate aggregation levels of the query.

**Task 2**: For each visited country (City.country) in South America, calculate a trend for the number of visitors. 

**Task 3**: For each age group (Age.name), year and month, determine the profit, cumulative profit and the percentage of profit for a given month / year within the given age group. Include a summary without age and time dimensions. Format the query result appropriately.

**Task 4**: For each visited country (City.country) of South America, calculate two rankings for the visited cities: (1) descending ranking by the number of visitors (2) increasing ranking by the city's profit Note: the result should also include cities that have not been visited yet (they should be at the end of both rankings). 

**Task 5**: For each European visited country (City.country) and age group (Age.name), calculate the number of visits. Present the data in the form of a pivot table: the age group should be listed in the column, while the name of the visited country should be displayed in the rows. Include a summary for each age group (last row in the result below) and for each country (last column).
